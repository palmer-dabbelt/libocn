libocn: An on-chip network generator library

This library is designed to generate on-chip networks for use by the
DREAMER project.  The general idea is that this hides away the actual
network layout and only allows users to ask "what is the cost to go
from node A to B?" and "what are the routes availiable to A?".

An example of how to use the library can be seen in
src/shortest_path.c++.
